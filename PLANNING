	Tetratasmagoria is a two player hybrid of Tetris and Touhou. While one player is trying to lay down an endless supply of tetrominos, the other is trying to survive an endless bullet hell boss battle. The better each player does, the harder the other player’s game gets. Whoever survives longer wins.
